# Digital Wallet and Agent Overviews Special Interest Group (SIG)

The objectives of this SIG is to further develop and maintain the Digital Wallet Overview and making a similar overview for digital identity agents/SDKs. These overviews should provide transparency of the characteristics of wallets and agents in order to allow for comparison and effective decision making on which wallet is applicable for your use case. By creating awareness of these overviews, this work can lead to less fragmentation of the SSI playing field and increase adoption.

This SIG was accepted by the TAC on [September 20, 2023](../meetings/2023/2023-09-20.md). See [Digital Wallet and Agent Overviews SIG Proposal](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/56) for more details.

## Target Audience
This overview should be usable by persons and organisations. Anyone willing to use digital wallets or agents for digital credential purposes should be able to objectively compare the characteristics of wallets/agents and create a short-list of candidates for their use case. It can also serve as resource for market awareness and visibiility of wallets/agents for wallet/agent vendors.

## Scoping
We use the terminilogy on digital credentials, wallets and agets as described in the ToIP glossary.

Included in the overview are holder agents+wallets, issuer agents and verifier agents. Initially, we will only include wallets and agents that at least have the functionality to store and exchange digital credentials.
