# Digital Wallet and Agent Overviews Special Interest Group (SIG)

The objectives of this SIG is to further develop and maintain the Digital Wallet Overview and including the digital identity agents/SDKs in the overview. The overview can be found [here](https://openwallet-foundation.github.io/digital-wallet-and-agent-overviews-sig/). These overview should provide transparency of the characteristics of wallets and agents in order to allow for comparison and effective decision-making on which wallet is applicable for your use case. By creating awareness of these overviews, this work can lead to less fragmentation of the SSI playing field and increase adoption.

The characteristics that form the basis for comparison of wallets or agents are collaboratively defined and regularly updated by a diverse group of contributors, ensuring that no single provider can unduly influence the overview. This approach guarantees a level playing field, with each provider fairly represented. Moreover, to ensure unbiased access, the entries are randomized, giving each provider an equal opportunity to be noticed. Importantly, our commitment to transparency is underscored by the absence of affiliate links, ensuring that our recommendations are guided solely by the merit of the solutions and not by commercial incentives. This matrix is not just a list - it's a user-centric guide shaped by collective expertise and a commitment to fairness.

## Target Audience

This overview should be usable by persons and organisations. Anyone willing to use digital wallets or agents for digital credential purposes should be able to objectively compare the characteristics of wallets/agents and create a short-list of candidates for their use case. It can also serve as resource for market awareness and visibility of wallets/agents for wallet/agent vendors.

## Scoping

We use the terminilogy on digital credentials, wallets and agents as described in the [ToIP glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZByfuSOwszDRkE7ARQLeElSYmVznoOyJK4sxRvJpyM/edit).

Included in the overview are holder agents+wallets, issuer agents and verifier agents. Initially, we will only include wallets and agents that at least have the functionality to store and exchange digital credentials.

## Connection to other OWF groups

This SIG was accepted by the TAC on [September 20, 2023](../meetings/2023/2023-09-20.md). See [Digital Wallet and Agent Overviews SIG Proposal](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/tac/issues/56) for more details.

There is a strong connection with the credential format comparison SIG. The credential formats are incorporated as separate characterics (columns) in the overview, forming the basis of the technology stack.

We foresee that the safe wallet SIG provided us with new characteristics in the category of 'Security'. 

## Contributing

### Why should I add my digital wallet or agent?

We strive to create a comprehensive and unbiased platform where every provider can showcase their solution at no cost. Recognising the challenge in quantifying subjective aspects, such as user-friendliness, our focus is on objective parameters. These include resource links and compliance with specific standards, ensuring clear, fact-based comparisons. By allowing and encouraging community contributions through pull requests, we maintain an up-to-date and inclusive matrix. Your active participation by submitting updates or new entries is invaluable, as it not only ensures the overview is correct and complete, but also supports a more informed and diverse user base.

### How can I add my digital wallet or agent?
Contributing to the overview can be done through filling in the form provided when clicking "Add Wallet/agent" in the upper right corner of the overview (soon to be added). This creates the JSON that should be added to `wallets.json` via a pull request.
